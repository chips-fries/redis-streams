```bash
# Clone repo and install dependencies
poetry install

# Set up environment variable for token (via .env or .envrc)

## ðŸ§ª API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                         |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/status/{env}`        | Check stream status for given env   |
| GET    | `/status`              | Check all environment stream status |
| POST   | `/publish/{env}`       | Publish a message to the stream     |

| DELETE | `/clear`               | Clear all environment streams       |

> **Note:** All endpoints require a `token` header for authentication.

## ðŸ§¼ Code Quality

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce formatting and linting.

To run all pre-commit checks manually:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
